Inheritance and Abstraction 
Create an abstract class Medicine to represent a drug manufactured by a pharmaceutical company
 with attributes price and expiry date and a method getDetails() to print them. 
 Also include an abstract function displayLabel() in the Medicine class. 
 
Derive Tablet, Syrup and Ointment classes from the Medicine class. 
Override the displayLabel() function in each of these classes
 to print additional information suitable to the type of medicine. 
 For example, in case of tablets, it could be “store in a cool dry place”, 
 in case of ointments it could be “for external use only” etc.
 
 
Create a class TestMedicine with the main method
 that declares an array of Medicine references of size 5.
  Create a medicine object of the type Tablet/Syrup/Ointment as
   decided by a randomly generated integer in the range 1 to 3. 
   (Refer Java API Documentation to find out random number generation)
    Check the polymorphic behavior of the displayLabel() method.
